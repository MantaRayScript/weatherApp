## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I want to thank [Mateusz Maj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-maj-b003b6178/?originalSubdomain=pl) for the awesome job he does in his courses for Front-end Developer wannabies like me. I highly recommend his videos to any Polish speaking person who would like to learn about HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and more. Thanks to him I didn't loose my motivation and I'm progressing in Front-end knowledge. I hope one day to work as a developer. :heart:
